# E-Commerce Project README

## Introduction

Welcome to the E-Commerce Project, a web application that leverages React.js and Next.js for the frontend and Spring Boot with MongoDB for the backend. This project aims to provide a solid foundation for building an online shopping platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Java Development Kit (JDK 8+)
- MongoDB
- Spring Boot
- Git (optional)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-project.git
   ```

   If you don't have Git, you can also download the project as a ZIP file from the repository.

2. Navigate to the project's root directory:

   ```bash
   cd ecommerce-project
   ```

3. Frontend Setup (React.js and Next.js):

   a. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

      ```bash
      cd frontend
      ```

   b. Install the required dependencies:

      ```bash
      npm install
      ```

   c. Start the frontend development server:

      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

   The frontend should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Backend Setup (Spring Boot with MongoDB):

   a. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

      ```bash
      cd backend
      ```

   b. Build and run the Spring Boot application:

      ```bash
      ./mvnw spring-boot:run
      ```

   The backend should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
